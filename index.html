      <p>In ages long past, the gods of old created the realms. In these realms lied various creatures including that of man. Man sought to gain power but in their hubris
          they sought to overthrow the gods. Slowly and like parasites the armies of man destroyed the gods and in doing so ushered in an era of horror. Without the gods man was 
          defenseless as the demons and their gods rush from the bowels of the underworld. Kingdoms and armies fell, many died, and now the world no longer has life....You thought this was it.
          That is very depressing but don't worry. The world has hope. There is always hope. Since a story that has no hope and no happy ending is really just a depression fantasy.....But here's the current.....
